# Seedhost rTorrent remote testing

The Chunks Android client can derive a candidate XML-RPC plugin endpoint from an HTTPS ruTorrent web URL. This is not proof that the endpoint works for the owner's instance.

## Exact credential contract

The owner confirmed these repository-secret names (case-sensitive):
- `rtorrent_user`
- `rtorrent_pass`

The manual-only `seedhost-readonly-probe.yml` workflow now consumes exactly those secrets. It accepts a **credential-free HTTPS ruTorrent URL as a Run workflow input**; there is no required URL secret. Use the ruTorrent web login URL already supplied to the project when dispatching.

Its only request is `system.client_version`. The workflow refuses off-provider hostnames, URLs embedding credentials or query/fragment data, and redirects. It does not log the server URL, password, returned version, XML response, info hashes or file inventory. Do not put real credentials into GitHub workflow inputs or code.

The credential values cannot be read via available GitHub connector tools and were not retrieved. A passing Kotlin/Android build does not prove the credentialed probe succeeded; record the workflow run and sanitized result separately when it runs.

## Next gates

After the protected version probe succeeds, test method listing, view/list completeness and browser/Android authentication behavior, without dumping private torrent names. Only then prototype remote write methods against disposable transfers. Live relocation remains blocked pending crash-safe verification.

Seedhost general integration docs describe `/rutorrent/plugins/httprpc/action.php` and deployment-specific variants such as `/RPC1`. Never assume a setter has moved files.
